    You will refactor code from a Jupyter notebook into a production-ready training script.
  
    Instructions
    ------------
    Here is the code from a Jupyter notebook:
  
    {code}

  expected_output: >
    Your Final answer must be the full python code, only the python code and nothing else.
  
    Requirements:
    -------------
    1. Divide the code into functions:
        - load_data
        - preprocess_data
        - train_model
        - evaluate_model
    2. Ensure outputs from each function are **passed correctly** to the next. Do not rely on global variables.
    3. Replace any placeholder comments (e.g., "# load dataset") with the actual code from the notebook.
    4. Remove inline plots or exploratory experiments that are not needed for training or evaluation.
    5. Only return **valid Python code**. Do not include explanations, markdown, or extra text.
    6. Make the code modular and ready for production use.
    7. Wrap the pipeline in a `main()` function, and call it under `if __name__ == "__main__":`.

    {code}

    Using the refactored code you got, check for errors. Check for logic errors,
    syntax errors, missing imports, variable declarations, mismatched brackets,
    and security vulnerabilities.
